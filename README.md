Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.


Basic Image Classification using SVM (Optimized Input Pipeline)

This repository contains my solution for Task 04 of the Prodigy InfoTech 
Machine Learning Internship. The aim of this task was to perform image 
classification using classical ML techniques instead of deep learning.

I worked with a folder-based image dataset and focused mainly on optimizing 
the loading pipeline so that the model trains quickly. Images were converted 
to grayscale, resized, flattened, and used as input to an SVM classifier.

Highlights
- Faster image loading  
- Grayscale + resizing for lightweight processing  
- SVM classifier with linear kernel  
- Accuracy report and observations  
- Supports any custom dataset with subfolders
